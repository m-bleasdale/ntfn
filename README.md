# No Time For News

[ntfn.co.uk](https://ntfn.co.uk)

**No Time For News aims to provide accurate, impartial, no-nonsense news to readers.**

It focuses on providing readers with only the most important stories, and explorations of general trends within politics or world news. Our platform is quite literally for people that have No Time For News. Only the important stories, and only the important information. No bias. No nonsense. That’s it.

We also wanted to create an opportunity for students, like ourselves, to do something real. At No Time For News, everything including our research, articles, social media posts, website, paperwork, is created by students.

This site is built using Next.js and uses MDX files to store articles. In the future, a custom CMS will be built, however at the moment the existing system works for our small team of journalists.

We welcome talented aspiring journalists, developers, lawyers, marketing professionals, etc to reach out to us at **contact@ntfn.co.uk** if they want to get involved. Or DM us on social media. Any amount of experience is welcome, even if you’ve never written anything before.
