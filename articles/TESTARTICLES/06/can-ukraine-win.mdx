As the war between Ukraine and Russia stretches into its third year, the question "Can Ukraine win?" has become both more urgent and more difficult to answer. In the early days of the invasion, Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia’s much larger military stunned the world. With bold leadership, strong morale, and widespread international support, Ukraine repelled Russian forces from Kyiv and mounted counteroffensives that reclaimed significant territory. But the war has since ground into a prolonged and punishing conflict. With entrenched front lines, mounting casualties, and signs of political fatigue in the West, the nature of victory — and whether it is still attainable — is increasingly in doubt.

### The Military Reality on the Ground

Ukraine’s armed forces have demonstrated remarkable skill, innovation, and resilience. They’ve effectively used Western-supplied weapons like HIMARS and air defense systems to limit Russian advances and disrupt logistics. Ukrainian troops have adapted quickly, learning how to fight a modern, high-tech war against a larger opponent. However, the battlefield situation has become more difficult. Russian forces have fortified defensive lines across occupied territories, making further Ukrainian advances slow and costly.

Moreover, Russia’s shift to a wartime economy and partial mobilization has allowed it to sustain a long-term military campaign. Ukraine, by contrast, depends heavily on international aid — both military and financial. Ammunition shortages, delays in Western support, and the sheer toll of continuous warfare have all taken their toll. Ukrainian offensives in 2023 achieved limited success, underscoring the challenge of breaking through Russia’s defenses without air superiority or significant new weaponry.

### The Importance of Western Support

A key factor in Ukraine’s continued resistance is the support of its allies, particularly the United States and European Union. Western nations have provided billions in military aid, training, and humanitarian assistance. However, this support is not guaranteed. Political divisions in the U.S. Congress and shifts in leadership in countries like Slovakia and Hungary have raised questions about the durability of this backing.

Ukraine’s path to victory is inseparable from this support. Without sustained deliveries of advanced weaponry — including air defense systems, long-range missiles, and potentially F-16 fighter jets — Ukraine's ability to hold its lines or push forward is limited. Western unity has held thus far, but as the war drags on, fatigue and competing domestic priorities could weaken the resolve of Ukraine’s most important partners.

### What Does 'Winning' Look Like?

Part of the difficulty in answering whether Ukraine can win lies in defining what "winning" means. For Ukraine, the official goal remains the full restoration of its 1991 borders — including Crimea. For many Ukrainians, anything short of this would be a betrayal of those who have died defending their country. Yet achieving that goal militarily may not be feasible in the near term, given the realities on the battlefield and the risk of escalation with a nuclear-armed adversary.

A more pragmatic version of victory might involve pushing Russia back from key strategic areas, securing international guarantees for future security, and forcing Russia to accept a settlement that preserves Ukraine’s sovereignty. Such an outcome may not be as emotionally satisfying, but it could realistically end the war on terms favorable to Kyiv — provided Russia faces enough pressure to negotiate.

### Russia's Position and Potential Weaknesses

Russia has suffered substantial losses in both manpower and equipment, and international sanctions have deeply hurt its economy. Yet the Kremlin has managed to maintain control at home, in part through repression and propaganda. While cracks in Russian political stability have occasionally surfaced — such as the short-lived Wagner rebellion — Vladimir Putin’s grip on power appears intact for now.

However, prolonged warfare can bring unexpected consequences. If Russia’s military continues to bleed resources or morale collapses, internal dissent could grow. Ukraine and its allies hope that, over time, pressure from the battlefield combined with economic hardship could force a change in Moscow’s strategy — or even its leadership. But betting on internal collapse is risky and uncertain.

### Conclusion: A Long Road Ahead

So, can Ukraine win? Yes — but perhaps not in the absolute, all-encompassing sense originally hoped for. A total military victory that expels Russian forces from every inch of Ukrainian territory is unlikely in the short term. However, a form of strategic victory — securing its independence, defending key territories, and deterring future aggression — is still possible.

Achieving that outcome depends on Ukraine's continued resilience, the commitment of its allies, and Russia’s capacity to sustain its war effort. It will likely take years, not months, and come at a high cost. But if "winning" means preserving Ukraine as a free, sovereign, and democratic state, then that goal remains within reach — and worth fighting for.
