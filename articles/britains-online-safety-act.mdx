Recently, the British Online Safety Act appears to have taken the world by storm, but not for the reasons the government hoped for. The government claims that the Act was put in place to create a safer space for users all over the country, mainly through restricting a child’s access to harmful content such as pornography. However, many criticise the age verification systems put in place as ‘dystopian’ and a complete breach of a user’s privacy. But what is the Online Safety Act - and how much will it truly affect the lives of the average British adult and child alike?

### What is the Online Safety Act?
The Online Safety Act was put into legislation back in 2023 under Rishi Sunak's conservative government.<Pointer number="1" /> Labour has decided not to repeal the Act and to continue implementing it with Ofcom’s support. The objective of this Act is to create new guidelines for online forums, social media apps and search services to make Britain “the safest place in the world to be online”.<Pointer number="1" /> To enforce these guidelines, the UK government is working with Ofcom - the UK's communications regulator - which oversees broadcasting, telecommunications, and postal industries.

Despite the Act originally being passed in 2023, it is only now, in 2025, that we are starting to see many of the clauses come into effect. This is because of the need to give platforms due warning so that they could have time to implement the necessary changes. These changes include a clause that came into effect on the 17th of March 2025, which means that platforms now have a legal obligation to remove any form of illegal content.<Pointer number="2" /> However, the most controversial clause is that which came into effect on the 25th of July, which means that all platforms have a legal duty to protect children online.<Pointer number="2" /> What this essentially means is that all platforms containing any content deemed to be ‘harmful’ to those under 18 must have a form of age verification system preventing children from accessing that content. Examples of content which Ofcom deem ‘harmful’ include content which promotes suicide, self-harm and eating disorders in addition to pornographic content.<Pointer number="3" />

Any platform that fails to meet this criteria will be banned in the UK and fined for potentially 18 million pounds or 10 percent of their revenue.<Pointer number="4" />

### Why has this Act been introduced?
Ofcom has voiced their concerns regarding pornography consumption in young children, arguing that it is too easy for children to access this type of content online. In a study, they claimed to have found that around eight per cent of children aged 8-14 in the UK visited some form of online porn site during the month in which the study took place.<Pointer number="3" /> Furthermore, they also warned that the total figure of under-18s who accessed pornograph could be much higher. Since Ofcom estimates that there are a total of 14 million people accessing pornography,<Pointer number="5" /> they argue that more of these people need to be tested in order to keep the internet a safe place for children.

### How will checks take place?
Ofcom has voiced its concerns regarding pornography consumption in young children, arguing that it is too easy for children to access this type of content online. In a study, they claimed to have found that around eight per cent of children aged 8-14 in the UK visited some form of online porn site during the month in which the study took place.<Pointer number="3" /> Furthermore, they also warned that the total figure of under-18s who accessed pornograph could be much higher. Since Ofcom estimates that there are a total of 14 million people accessing pornography,<Pointer number="5" /> they argue that more of these people need to be tested to keep the internet a safe place for children.

Ofcom have posted a list of potential methods of age verification on their website:

- Facial age estimation – you show your face via photo or video, and technology analyses it to estimate your age.

- Open banking – you give permission for the age-check service to securely access information from your bank about whether you are over 18. The age-check service then confirms this with the site or app.

- Digital identity services – these include digital identity wallets, which can securely store and share information which proves your age in a digital format.

- Credit card age checks – you provide your credit card details and a payment processor checks if the card is valid. As you must be over 18 to obtain a credit card this shows you are over 18.

- Email-based age estimation – you provide your email address, and technology analyses other online services where it has been used – such as banking or utility providers – to estimate your age.

- Mobile network operator age checks – you give your permission for an age-check service to confirm whether or not your mobile phone number has age filters applied to it. If there are no restrictions, this confirms you are over 18.

- Photo-ID matching – this is similar to a check when you show a document. For example, you upload an image of a document that shows your face and age, and an image of yourself at the same time – these are compared to confirm if the document is yours.

Popular platforms such as Reddit and Pornhub appear to be using persona,<Pointer number="6" /> which is a 3rd party organisation that uses facial images in order to estimate someone’s age.<Pointer number="7" />

What are the criticisms?
There have been a myriad of criticisms aimed towards this act and its implementation. However, three main issues stand out: privacy concerns, VPN bypasses and what content is deemed ‘harmful.’

The government’s definition of ‘harmful’ content has been criticised for being too vague, and the act does not define what type of content fits this description.<Pointer number="8" /> Furthermore, many have criticised how content is classified as harmful, arguing that much of what is getting age-restricted is unnecessary. For example, the music app Spotify has been profoundly affected by the Online Safety Act, with users having to give age verification to access over-18 videos.<Pointer number="9" /> Many argue that this is unnecessary, as it does not protect children but instead restricts the creative freedom of artists. This is because the Online Safety Act forces platforms to revise their algorithms to limit exposure to harmful content. For artists, this can mean that their content can be misclassified for simply referring to sensitive topics, which stifles creativity and stagnates discussion on topics such as suicide and self-harm.<Pointer number="9" /> Additionally, platforms such as Reddit are not simply restricting pornographic or violent content, but all content deemed NSFW (not safe for work).<Pointer number="10" /> This means that subreddits such as suicide help groups and subreddits talking about political situations are all banned under the Online Safety Act. Again, this raises concerns regarding free speech and expression, but also makes it harder for children and adults to access help forums.

Many adults are also expressing concerns regarding their privacy online. As stated earlier, neither the government nor Ofcom have provided their own methods of verifying ID, meaning that many platforms are using 3rd party organisations to do this. These organisations have no responsibilities towards the user nor the government, so many people are concerned that their data could be “retained, used or linked to other web activity”.<Pointer number="11" /> Naturally, many people are suspicious of their browsing being tracked, especially if the content they are accessing is pornographic. Platforms such as Reddit have responded to these concerns, stating that their 3rd party organisation, Persona, would only retain information for a maximum of 7 days.<Pointer number="7" /> However, 7 days is plenty of time for a data breach to occur, which could lead to hackers identifying browser histories. Additionally, checks which use passport ID could potentially lead to hackers gaining access to sensitive information, which could be used to commit fraud.<Pointer number="12" /> Issues such as these have led to a surge of skeptical British citizens downloading VPN’s (or virtual private networks). These VPN’s route internet traffic through servers in other countries, allowing users to bypass restrictions in the UK. According to 'Wired' magazine, VPN providers such as ProtonVPN found that their UK sign-ups had increased by a whopping 1400%.<Pointer number="13" /> The government has provided little response to these issues and has said that they are not thinking of banning VPN’s.

The outrage caused by the Act has undeniably shaken the country, and almost 500 thousand citizens have signed a petition to have it re-evaluated.<Pointer number="14" /> The future of the internet is uncertain to say the least - and it remains to be seen whether this Act will have the impact that the government and Ofcom hopes it will.
