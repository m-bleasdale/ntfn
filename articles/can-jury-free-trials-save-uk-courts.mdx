Recently, the former Lord Justice Leveson, now Sir Brian Leveson had discussed the possibility of having judge-only trials for certain cases such as fraud and bribery. The potential for significantly shortening and improving the efficiency of certain trials and cases has been significant and the discussion as to whether having a jury within a trial is a “basic right” has been debated. However, would this undermine the legitimacy of having a fair-trial?<Pointer number="1" />. With influential figures such as the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, arguing that “Swifter justice requires bold reform”,<Pointer number="2" /> Critics have been vocal about the potential issues regarding Jury-free trials. Issues raised range from: the Judicial system’s democratic integrity and the possibility of racial and discriminatory bias.
 
### The Significance of Juries: 
A jury is a group of people who have been chosen to listen to all the facts in a trial in a law court and to decide if a person is guilty or not guilty, or if a claim has been proved.<Pointer number="3" /> It can be argued that juries are not only a demonstration of democracy as the public decides on a legal verdict, but they are also key determiners of concluding trials in regards to facts. In England and Wales, jury summons must be responded to and confirmed within seven days, names are chosen randomly from the electoral register and usually up to 10 working days, individuals will be part of a twelve-person jury.<Pointer number="4" /> Needless to say, juries are a vital cornerstone in the pursuit of justice, in fact to share discussions from a deliberation room in which verdicts are discussed would be in substantial breach of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.<Pointer number="5" />

Additionally, there are legislative and procedural frameworks in place, such as the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Juries Act 1974 (as well as its many amendments) that have ensured the quality and efficiency of juries are of an adequate standard for quick and sufficient proceedings. For instance, Schedule 33 of the Criminal Justice Act of 2003 amends the principle statute governing jury service listed in the Juries Act 1974, where many of the categories of ineligibility and excusal “as of right” from jury service had been abolished.<Pointer number="6" /> This arguably could have meant that juries could be more representative of the public and therefore more effective verdicts and decisions can be made from juries. Overall, it can be argued that juries play a core and significant role in judicial decisions. 

### Background: 
Undoubtedly, a key legal maxim is the general principle of “Justice delayed is justice denied”, a foundation setting out how if legal remedies or damages and solutions are not awarded in time, justice has not been achieved, this principle may also take into account the vulnerability of both the defendant and victim/claimant during this time-frame of awaiting trial. The Crown Court backlog had reached a record high 73,105 cases in September 2024, a figure which had doubled from the figures toward the end of 2019 (38,016 cases).<Pointer number="7" /> Many individuals in the legal sector such as criminal defence solicitor Stephen Davies, have suggested that the reason for this substantial backlog is the result of: the significant disruptions to the courts from the COVID-19 pandemic (such as the shutting down of courts for extended periods of time), impactful cuts to the budget of courts, and the shortage of personnel and sitting judges to deal with these cases.<Pointer number="8" />  With His Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) receiving an annual net expenditure of £1.84 billion and employing 16,422 staff in 2023-24 the number of cases dealt by both the criminal courts (1.4 million cases) and the county courts (1.7 million cases) had increased from figures from pre-pandemic levels in (2019-2020).<Pointer number="9" /> The substantial backlog of cases and this increase has called for resolutions to be made to protect the key judicial principle of “Justice delayed is justice denied”. This resulted in the government setting out an enquiry to discover the reasons to cut these waiting times and to reduce the backlog, the investigation led by Sir Brian Leveson has recently led to the discussion of a jury-free trial. 

### A Discussion in Progress:
Despite the potential benefits this may have to courts in England and Wales and the fulfillment of the principle of preventing delayed justice, many critics have discussed the significant and potential dangers of jury-free trials. For example, Paul Mendelle KC wrote in 2010 that “Juries are one of the most democratic aspects of the constitution; they are democracy in action everyday of the week” and how “there is no other part of the constitution so open to the public”.<Pointer number="10" /> Additionally, a study from University College London (UCL) and reports from the Ministry of Justice in 2010 had concluded that jurors are highly unlikely to have racial bias and would largely convict the majority of rape cases with a (55% conviction rate in crown court rape trials).<Pointer number="11" /> Overall, an argument can be made that a consensus of jury-free trials being an effective means to cut costs could threaten the democratic integrity of the courts. 

On the other hand, it can be argued that from an economical perspective, jury-free trials are an effective remedy to the shortage of court personnel as the reduction in jury service could have a positive impact on the wider economic environment. Lengthy trials and increases in the number of cases could be said to have impacts on aggregate economic productivity, this may influence the levels of taxation and therefore the levels of government expenditure on the courts. It can be argued that an increase in the number of judge-only cases could not only allow courts to be more efficient and effective, but as there are more individuals in employment, increased economic productivity from less people committing to jury service could have potential benefits in regards to taxation and therefore government expenditure on court services. This may potentially resolve many of the issues such as personnel shortages, due to more investment in court and tribunal services. However, it can also be argued that realistically, external economic factors may interfere with the possible economic benefits of jury-free trials. 

However, in regards to the potential social conflicts of jury-free trials, many charities have warned that an increase in the number of trials with no jury could disadvantage ethnic minorities and possibly contribute to a higher number of miscarriages of justice. Matt Foot, co-director of the charity Appeal argues that judges represent a narrow section of society often being “privately educated and white”, in which he argues is “a long way away from the makeup of juries”.<Pointer number="12" /> Statistics have also shown a lack of judicial diversity in regards to race and ethnicity with black people making up 1.3% of court judges and 1.7% of tribunal judges.<Pointer number="13" /> It can be argued that judge-only trials could be more susceptible to unconscious racial bias, possibly contributing to a higher level of miscarriages of justice and unfair verdicts being given. 

### Comparing Acquittal Rates: United Kingdom and Germany:
In order to highlight the impact of Jury-free trials, the judicial system of Germany in which there have been no jury trials since 1924 could be used as a comparison from the UK’s (As of writing in July 2025) largely jury-dependent trials. Most cases are typically tried by a panel of professional and lay judges (the “Schoffen”).<Pointer number="14" /> An acquittal is when the decision of a court finds that someone is not guilty when charged.<Pointer number="15" /> Arguably, a jury acts as a second voice in the courts, a voice representative of the general public and resultantly this has a significant influence on the number of acquittals and convictions. In 2020, the courts of Germany had convicted approximately 699,300 defendants by final judgement, with only 153,300 individuals with other court proceedings such as acquittal or dismissal of proceedings, which would be around 18%.<Pointer number="16" /> According to the crown prosecution service, the conviction rate in 2023-24 was 60.2%, suggesting 40.8% would have been other court proceedings including acquittals.<Pointer number="17" /> Arguably, the significance of a jury can be reflected in the number of acquittals using the example of Germany’s acquittal rates of 18% reflecting the influence without a jury and England and Wales’ acquittal rate of 40.8%. 

To conclude, the significance of juries to the constitutional and judicial system of England and Wales is substantial, juries not only influence the levels of acquittals and convictions but they are a presence in the courts of England and Wales symbolic of democracy. However, when faced with the trade-off of delays in judicial proceedings in addition to the potential “collapse” of UK courts, a jury-free trial could be one of many solutions to resolve the matter.
