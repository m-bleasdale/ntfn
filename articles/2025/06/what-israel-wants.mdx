**As of late June 2025, Israel finds itself at a pivotal moment in its history—embroiled in a multifront campaign, balancing existential threats, diplomatic ambitions, domestic pressures, and global optics. The key question within Israel’s leadership, its citizens, and the world: what does Israel want, and at what cost?**

## Security as an Imperative

At the heart of Israel’s national ethos lies an unwavering focus on security. This is neither new nor unexpected. Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has faced repeated wars, terrorist attacks, rocket fire, and threats from hostile neighbors. The trauma of the Holocaust, the Yom Kippur War, and more recently, the 2023 Hamas attacks—referred to domestically as the “October 7th Massacre”—inform a collective psyche that interprets most threats as existential.

Today, that threat is most prominently embodied by Iran. Israel believes that Iran’s nuclear ambitions, support for militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and its rhetoric around Israel’s destruction amount to more than posturing. The strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities in June 2025—though condemned by some international observers—are presented by Israel as preemptive self-defense. Israeli officials have insisted they are not seeking war for its own sake, but rather preventing one they believe is inevitable if Iran continues its current trajectory.

To outsiders, this can appear aggressive, even provocative. But from the perspective of Israeli policymakers, deterrence is not optional—it is the mechanism by which the state survives.

Israel's long-standing concern is clear: preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and advanced ballistic missile systems.

* **Operation Rising Lion**, launched in mid‑June, marked a significant escalation. Israeli air strikes, backed by Mossad drone sabotage deep within Iran, targeted nuclear sites in Natanz, Isfahan, and Tehran, as well as missile infrastructure ([washingtonpost.com][1], [france24.com][2], [afn.net][3], [faf.ae][4]).
* Strong signals from Israeli officials—such as Defense Minister Israel Katz—placed the deeply buried Fordow site “in the bank of targets,” stressing urgency ([reuters.com][5]).
* Israeli leaders fear that allowing Iran's nuclear ambitions to advance would recreate a strategic imbalance in the region and threaten Israel’s core security.

Israel’s military goal is narrowly defined: dismantle nuclear capability and reduce missile threats before they cross a perceived "red line" that could no longer be reversed.


## Shaping the Regional Order

While security concerns dominate the discourse, Israel’s ambitions are not limited to defense. Over the past decade, a shift has occurred: from merely surviving in a hostile neighborhood to actively shaping it. The Abraham Accords—normalization deals signed with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco—signaled a major reorientation. These agreements bypassed the Palestinian issue and focused on economic, technological, and security cooperation.

What Israel wants now is to expand that normalization, especially with heavyweight states like Saudi Arabia. Achieving diplomatic ties with Riyadh would be a geopolitical coup, reshaping alliances in the Middle East and marginalizing Iran’s influence. However, the war in Gaza and the resulting civilian casualties have made this goal more elusive. Saudi leaders, under pressure from their public and regional allies, have slowed talks and made demands that Israel has yet to accept.

This reflects a deeper tension: the more Israel asserts itself militarily, the more it risks alienating potential partners. Yet Israeli leaders calculate that regional powers also fear Iranian expansionism and political instability, which makes cooperation with Israel—overt or covert—an enduring interest.

A key question persists: how far will Israel push before triggering wider conflict?

* Iran responded with massive missile and drone strikes on June 13—150 ballistic missiles and over 100 drones—against Israeli territory, killing a small number and causing public alarm ([reuters.com][5], [en.wikipedia.org][12]).
* Some analysts argue a decisive Israeli advance might suppress Iran’s regional deterrence; others warn a prolonged campaign risks igniting an uncontrollable regional war .
* With Gulf states watching warily, and Russia publicly cautioning that the world is “millimeters away from nuclear catastrophe,” Israel must balance military momentum with risk ([time.com][13]).

Israel’s calculus: dismantle threats firmly, yet avoid tipping the region into chaos.

### Bottom Line

**What does Israel want?** The answer lies in multiple intersecting objectives:

1. **Tangible elimination** of Iran’s nuclear and missile capabilities.
2. **Strategic erosion** of the Iranian regime and its regional networks.
3. **Demonstrable deterrence**, bolstering internal cohesion and external respect.
4. **Diplomatic leverage**, seeking broader normalization across the Arab and Western world.
5. **Preserved partnership with the U.S.**, but with an active, independent posture.
6. **Calculated regional influence**, maximizing gains while minimizing escalation.
7. **Compliance with international law**, or at least plausible deniability.
8. **A new regional architecture**, potentially anchored by a redefined Israel.

Yet each goal brings risks: from regional conflagration and internal dissent to diplomatic isolation and legal exposure. Israel’s leadership has staked much; whether these gambits yield lasting success—or costly backlash—remains unresolved.
