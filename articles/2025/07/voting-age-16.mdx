The UK government has revealed plans to lower the voting age to 16 across all elections, giving 1.5 million more young people the chance to vote by the next general election.<Pointer number="1" /> This move brings the rest of the UK in line with Scotland and Wales, where 16-year-olds already vote in local elections and devolved parliaments.<Pointer number="1" />

Along with this shift, the government is rolling out broader electoral reforms, including expanding acceptable voter ID to include UK-issued bank cards, automating voter registration, and tightening political donation rules to protect against foreign influence.<Pointer number="2" /> The message is clear: young people work, pay taxes, and join the military - it's time they had a say in how the country is run.<Pointer number="2" />

While the proposal has sparked debate, with critics pointing to concerns over maturity and the influence of social media, studies show that 16-year-olds tend to vote more consistently than first-time voters at 18. The change could also sway election outcomes in marginal constituencies.<Pointer number="3" />

The Liberal Democrats have long championed this reform, pushing for a greater youth voice in politics, and are pleased that the government is moving forward with the plan.<Pointer number="4" /> Additionally, the Office for National Statistics has noted that 16- and 17-year-olds could have impacted the results of 88 constituencies in 2017, potentially altering the balance of power in closely contested areas.<Pointer number="5" />

In short, lowering the voting age is a bold move aimed at modernising democracy - whether you agree with it or not, it could shape the future of UK elections.
