The United Nations Security Council has held urgent meetings following alarming reports of growing starvation in Gaza. At least 10 more Palestinians, including children, died of malnutrition in the last 24 hours, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, bringing the hunger death toll to 111.<Pointer number="1" />
The worsening crisis is the result of a months-long blockade on humanitarian aid, imposed by Israel amid its ongoing military campaign. Aid convoys remain stuck outside Gaza, while hundreds of civilians have been killed trying to collect food at distribution points.<Pointer number="2" />

UN officials have described the situation as “a horror show” and warned that famine is now spreading rapidly.<Pointer number="3" /> UNICEF reported that cases of child malnutrition have surged by 180% since the conflict began.<Pointer number="4" /> Children are reportedly dying of hunger, with some aid workers now fainting from malnutrition themselves.<Pointer number="5" />

More than 100 humanitarian and rights organisations, including Oxfam, Médecins Sans Frontières and Save the Children, have accused Israel of deliberately using starvation as a weapon of war. They are demanding that all land crossings into Gaza be opened immediately, under UN oversight.<Pointer number="6" />

Amnesty International stated that the starvation of civilians under siege conditions may constitute a war crime under international law.<Pointer number="7" /> The group reported that 875 people had been killed while seeking food, either en route to or at aid distribution sites.<Pointer number="7" />

Israeli officials deny that famine exists and blame Hamas for seizing aid. However, humanitarian groups say the scale of need far exceeds any local interference and have criticised the international community’s failure to act decisively.<Pointer number="6" />

UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for the immediate expansion of humanitarian access and full protection of civilians, warning that starvation is now “knocking on every door” in Gaza.<Pointer number="3" />

The significance of this story lies not only in the scale of human suffering but also in the potential breach of international norms. The UN Security Council’s response could shape future humanitarian interventions in conflict zones, and the international legal implications may set a precedent for how wartime sieges are judged.

As the crisis deepens, global pressure is mounting for a ceasefire and a UN-led humanitarian mechanism to avert further catastrophe. For the people of Gaza, the coming days may be a matter of life or death.
