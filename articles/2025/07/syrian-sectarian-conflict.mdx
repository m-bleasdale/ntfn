Syria has once again plunged into violence, with deadly sectarian clashes erupting in the southern province of Sweida. Fighting between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin tribes has left over 900 people dead and tens of thousands displaced, marking the deadliest violence since former dictator President Bashar al-Assad’s ousting last year, when his regime collapsed in civil war.<Pointer number="1" />

These events are part of a broader sectarian conflict – referring to tensions rooted in religious or ethnic divisions – that has long plagued the region.

The conflict began with retaliatory kidnappings between Druze and Bedouin factions, quickly escalating into widespread violence involving heavy weaponry, mortar fire, and executions.<Pointer number="1" /> The fighting has devastated the Druze-majority city of Sweida, with hospitals overwhelmed, electricity cut, and food shortages worsening by the day.<Pointer number="2" />

Despite a ceasefire announcement by Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, violence has persisted on the ground.<Pointer number="3" /> Bedouin fighters have reportedly withdrawn from the city under international pressure, but armed groups remain in surrounding areas, leaving the truce fragile at best.<Pointer number="4" />

The United States brokered the ceasefire, backed by Israel, Jordan, and Turkey.<Pointer number="1" /> However, tensions remain high as both Druze and Bedouin leaders accuse each other of war crimes. Humanitarian corridors have been only partially successful, and looting continues in many parts of the city.<Pointer number="2" />

Israel has carried out airstrikes against Syrian government positions during the unrest, claiming to defend Druze communities in the region.<Pointer number="5" /> These strikes have killed scores and intensified regional instability. Damascus condemned the bombings as violations of sovereignty, straining already frayed regional relations.<Pointer number="5" />

This outbreak is a critical test for President Sharaa, who came to power eight months ago promising unity after the fall of Assad. His government is now being criticised for failing to control sectarian militias and for alienating ethnic and religious minorities.<Pointer number="6" /> Druze leaders, in particular, have expressed deep mistrust in the central authorities, fearing marginalisation and betrayal.<Pointer number="7" />

The conflict has laid bare the fragility of Syria’s post-Assad transition. Sectarian wounds run deep, and the resurgence of communal violence threatens to derail efforts at national reconciliation. Political observers warn that if this situation spirals further, Syria could fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines, repeating the darkest chapters of its civil war.<Pointer number="6" />

For a public largely focused on Syria’s recovery from dictatorship, this outbreak serves as a stark reminder: the road to peace in Syria is long, and the ghosts of the past are far from buried.
