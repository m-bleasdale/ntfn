The UK unemployment rate has surged to 4.7% in the three months to May 2025, the highest since the April to June quarter of 2021, with 1.67 million people now seeking work, up 98,000 from the prior quarter.<Pointer number="1" /> This rise, driven by Aprilâ€™s increase in employer National Insurance contributions, has led to significant job cuts, particularly in hospitality, with 108,000 jobs lost.<Pointer number="2" /> 

The government is introducing skills training and regional job schemes to counter the slowdown, but critics argue that tax hikes, including a 6.7% minimum wage increase, are stifling businesses.<Pointer number="3" /> The Recruitment and Employment Confederation warns unemployment could hit 4.8% by year-end without action.<Pointer number="2" /> Despite the downturn, wage growth of 5.2% outpaces inflation, offering some relief.<Pointer number="4" />

In short, the cooling jobs market signals economic challenges, but targeted interventions may help stabilize the labour landscape.
