A political storm is brewing over former President Donald Trump’s past ties to Jeffrey Epstein, and it’s not just coming from his usual opponents. A new wave of scrutiny from Trump’s own supporters is shaking the foundations of his political movement and raising uncomfortable questions that are refusing to go away quietly.

At the centre of the uproar is a resurfaced 2003 birthday note allegedly sent by Trump to Epstein, containing a hand-drawn nude figure. The Wall Street Journal reported on the letter, sparking fierce backlash and denials from Trump, who claimed he had never drawn a picture in his life.<Pointer number="1" /> Yet critics quickly pointed to past examples of Trump’s public doodles sold at charity events.<Pointer number="2" />

Trump responded by filing a $10 billion (roughly £7.5 billion) defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch, accusing them of political sabotage and reputational harm.<Pointer number="3" /> His legal team argues the letter is fabricated, while his supporters have attempted to frame the media coverage as part of a wider smear campaign.<Pointer number="4" />

However, what’s driving the backlash now is not just the letter. For years, Trump has teased the public with claims that he would "expose the truth" about Epstein’s high-profile connections. Yet no meaningful disclosures have come—especially from officials Trump appointed in the US Department of Justice (the American body that oversees law enforcement), who recently confirmed no "client list" exists in federal files.<Pointer number="3" /> To many of his supporters, this silence now feels like betrayal.

Key conservative voices, including figures like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, have begun openly questioning Trump’s commitment to transparency. Some, like billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, have joined calls for a full unsealing of Epstein’s documents.<Pointer number="5" />  Others, such as Nikki Haley, have suggested Trump has failed to deliver on a promise that many of his anti-establishment voters considered vital.<Pointer number="6" /> 

This growing distrust marks a turning point. Trump’s supporters once saw him as the lone figure who would expose elite corruption. Now, some accuse him of protecting it. Even former allies, such as casino executive Jack O'Donnell, have stepped forward with claims that Trump and Epstein brought an underage woman to a New Jersey casino floor in the 1990s.<Pointer number="7" />

The significance of this story lies not just in its salacious details, but in the political fracture it exposes. Trump is facing dissent from within his own camp at a time when party unity is crucial. Polls indicate that faith in his credibility over Epstein is eroding—and with it, the unwavering loyalty of his supporters.<Pointer number="5" />

If this trend continues, the Epstein affair could become more than a public relations crisis. It could reshape the political landscape for the next major US elections, scheduled for 2026. The growing division within his movement could allow other right-wing figures to challenge Trump’s position at the helm of the Republican Party. For now, Trump remains defiant, but the chorus demanding answers is only growing louder.
