A huge earthquake hit eastern Russia on 29 July 2025, registering 8.8 magnitude near the Kamchatka Peninsula — an active volcanic region.<Pointer number="1" />

After the quake, tsunami warnings were issued across the Pacific: Russia, Japan, Hawaii, Alaska, the U.S. West Coast, Canada and even South American coastal zones.<Pointer number="2" /> In some coastal towns, waves reached up to 5 metres, flooding streets and port facilities in places like Severo‑Kurilsk.<Pointer number="3" />

Thanks to timely alerts and evacuations, no deaths have been reported.<Pointer number="4" /> A few injuries occurred from panic or falls, but most buildings held firm thanks to seismic design.<Pointer number="5" />

Japan evacuated nearly two million people and shut down its Fukushima nuclear plant as a precaution — no major issues occurred.<Pointer number="6" /> Hawaii, British Columbia, California and Alaska also enacted emergency protocols and moved people to safety.<Pointer number="2" />

This region lies within the Pacific “Ring of Fire” — a hotspot for earthquakes and volcanoes. The event underscores how one undersea quake can trigger global reach impacts.<Pointer number="7" />

Just weeks earlier, a 7.4 magnitude quake hit the same area, acting as a warning before the larger tremor.<Pointer number="8" /> On that occasion, tsunami alerts were issued but later rescinded when no damaging waves occurred.

The environmental toll is emerging too — whales and sea creatures have washed ashore, and debris has disrupted fragile ecosystems.<Pointer number="5" />

Adding to the drama, Russia’s Klyuchevskoy volcano erupted shortly after the quake, and scientists are investigating a possible link to the seismic event.<Pointer number="3" />

While the main tsunami threat has now passed, more aftershocks continue, and rescue teams are inspecting damage and ensuring public safety.<Pointer number="1" />

This story reveals the global nature of seismic disasters and the vital importance of early warning systems, emergency planning and international coordination when nature strikes.
