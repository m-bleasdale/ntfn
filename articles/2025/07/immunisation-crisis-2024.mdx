Despite decades of progress in eradicating vaccine-preventable diseases, 14 million children received no vaccines at all in 2024 - a tragic figure released by the United Nations in its joint WHO–UNICEF report this July.<Pointer number="1" /> This figure reflects growing global inequality, crumbling healthcare systems, and waning political resolve to protect the most vulnerable. The stagnation in global immunisation rates reveals that the post-pandemic recovery has not been inclusive - and could leave behind an entire generation.


### Who Are the “Zero-Dose” Children?


The term “zero-dose” refers to children who have not received a single dose of a routine childhood vaccine, such as DTP1 (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis). These children are overwhelmingly concentrated in low- and middle-income countries, often in remote or conflict-affected regions. According to WHO and UNICEF, nine countries accounted for more than half of the 14 million: India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia, the Philippines, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, Angola, and Brazil.<Pointer number="1" /> In these areas, barriers to vaccination include lack of access, distrust of government programmes, and rising religious or political opposition to Western medicine.<Pointer number="2" />


### A System Set Up to Fail


This crisis is as much about economic disparity as it is about healthcare. Many countries with large zero-dose populations face debt crises, austerity policies, and underfunded health sectors. Post-COVID-19, several governments prioritised debt repayment and emergency expenditure over routine immunisation programmes.<Pointer number="3" /> International aid has also declined, with donor fatigue and shifting geopolitical interests reducing contributions to GAVI and COVAX, hindering vaccine access in hard-to-reach regions.<Pointer number="4" />


### Vaccinations in Fragile States and Conflict Zones


In conflict-affected areas such as Sudan, Myanmar, Yemen, and northern Ethiopia, vaccination campaigns are nearly impossible. Infrastructure breakdowns, displacement, and attacks on health workers have created immunisation deserts. WHO officials warn that without safe humanitarian corridors, outbreaks of measles, cholera, and polio will rise significantly.<Pointer number="2" /> The weaponisation of healthcare - where warring parties withhold or destroy medical access - has exacerbated this crisis, making immunisation an issue of security, governance, and accountability.


### Misinformation and Vaccine Hesitancy


While access is the primary barrier in low-income countries, vaccine hesitancy is a growing challenge in middle- and high-income regions. In Brazil and the Philippines, misinformation spread by populist figures and conspiracy movements has eroded trust in immunisation campaigns.<Pointer number="5" /> Some communities falsely associate childhood vaccines with sterilisation agendas or Western manipulation, leading to refusal of free services. UNICEF notes that trust in health professionals is now a stronger predictor of vaccine uptake than income or education.<Pointer number="2" />


### The Gender Dimension: Disproportionate Impact on Girls


Girls are more likely to miss vaccines in patriarchal or conflict-affected societies where gender norms limit healthcare access. Female infants may be deprioritised or lack legal identification required in digital registration systems.<Pointer number="2" /> In refugee contexts, girls face additional barriers like early marriage, domestic confinement, and limited access to transport, further reducing their likelihood of immunisation.


### Conclusion


The stagnation of global childhood immunisation is both a moral failure and a public health emergency. It threatens decades of progress, risks outbreaks of long-contained diseases, and imposes massive economic costs on struggling nations. Fourteen million children without vaccines is a call to urgent global action. Without renewed solidarity and investment, the world risks betraying an entire generation.
