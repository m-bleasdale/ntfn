Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing a stark financial dilemma just weeks into her tenure. New analysis from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) reveals that Reeves must raise up to £41.2 billion to meet her fiscal rules by 2029, with an additional £9.9 billion needed to restore the financial buffer promised in Labour’s manifesto.<Pointer number="1" />

The situation, dubbed an "impossible trilemma" by economists, leaves Reeves with three difficult options: raise taxes, cut public spending, or abandon her own fiscal rules. With public services under strain and departmental budgets already tightly capped, tax rises are emerging as the most likely route.<Pointer number="2" />

NIESR suggests the chancellor could consider replacing council tax with a land value tax and revisiting income tax thresholds, among other measures.<Pointer number="1" /> Yet Labour’s firm pledge not to increase taxes on “working people” severely limits the government’s options.<Pointer number="3" />

Economic growth is not expected to provide much relief. Despite a modest upgrade to 2025 growth forecasts, long-term projections remain weak, meaning Reeves cannot rely on expanding revenues to fill the gap.<Pointer number="3" /> This leaves politically unpopular tax hikes as the most realistic path to meeting fiscal rules.

The alternatives are no less fraught. Cutting public services risks further deterioration in health, education and infrastructure, while abandoning fiscal discipline could spook markets and raise borrowing costs. Either way, Reeves will have to make politically costly decisions in the autumn budget.<Pointer number="4" />

The warning comes after years of sluggish economic growth, higher borrowing costs and the collapse of welfare reforms that were expected to reduce spending.<Pointer number="5" /> Economists say that without bold action, the UK risks fiscal drift and further economic stagnation.

Experts at Capital Economics and Bloomberg agree that the chancellor's ability to meet her targets now hinges on making unpopular calls.<Pointer number="6" /><Pointer number="7" /> These may include reducing pension tax relief, increasing VAT or National Insurance, or shifting tax burdens to higher earners.

For the public, the consequences could be far-reaching. Without new funding, many services risk further deterioration. If Reeves raises taxes, households already hit by inflation and rising mortgage rates may feel an added squeeze. And if she changes course on fiscal rules, the cost of government borrowing could rise sharply.<Pointer number="2" /><Pointer number="5" />

In short, Reeves is walking a fiscal tightrope. Every path has major implications for the economy, for the credibility of the government, and for voters who are still waiting for signs of economic renewal.
