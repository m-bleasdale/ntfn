A potentially game-changing summit between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled for 15 August 2025 in Alaska. The key focus is negotiating a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, which has raged since early 2022.<Pointer number="1" /> Trump has suggested that both Ukraine and Russia might have to cede territory as part of any settlement, a proposal that has alarmed Kyiv and its Western allies.<Pointer number="1" />

This meeting follows a series of intense diplomatic efforts. In early August, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow, and both Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly agreed that the conflict must end.<Pointer number="5" /> Despite these declarations, fighting continues on the ground, with Russian forces reportedly preparing new offensives and making advances in eastern Ukraine, underscoring the precarious nature of the situation.<Pointer number="2" />

The core tension lies in whether Ukraine will have to give up land to secure peace. Russia currently occupies about 19% of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea and parts of the Donbas region. Trump has hinted at "land swaps" or territorial exchanges to freeze the conflict, but Zelenskyy and Kyiv’s military strongly reject any concessions, emphasising Ukraine’s sovereignty and constitutional prohibitions against ceding land.<Pointer number="4" /><Pointer number="6" />

European leaders are deeply concerned about the possibility of a deal that rewards Russian aggression. They insist that any peace arrangement must be decided by Ukraine itself and include robust security guarantees. Ahead of the summit, the EU and NATO members have been coordinating closely, planning virtual meetings to strategise and present a united front.<Pointer number="1" /><Pointer number="7" />

Public opinion within Ukraine is mixed but wary. While a Gallup poll indicates 69% of Ukrainians support a negotiated end to the war, the same proportion doubts that a peace agreement will come soon. Ukrainian troops remain determined to fight and view a ceasefire without Russian withdrawal as unacceptable.<Pointer number="4" />

The upcoming summit resembles earlier diplomatic moments such as the 2021 U.S.-China talks in Anchorage, highlighting its geopolitical significance. If Trump and Putin reach a deal, it may effectively freeze battle lines without legal territorial changes, but this could still undermine Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO and leave unresolved sanctions on Russia.<Pointer number="3" /><Pointer number="6" />

Trump faces political risks at home, as any perceived appeasement of Putin could provoke backlash from both Republicans and Democrats. Meanwhile, European leaders, including the UK, have reiterated their support for Ukraine’s right to self-determination and vowed to accelerate arms deliveries and integration efforts if the Alaska summit leads to an unfavourable settlement.<Pointer number="3" /><Pointer number="7" /><Pointer number="8" />

In summary, the situation remains highly fluid. The world watches closely as Trump and Putin prepare to negotiate a ceasefire that could reshape Eastern Europe. Yet, with ongoing Russian offensives and Ukraine’s firm stance against territorial losses, the prospects for a lasting peace deal are uncertain.<Pointer number="2" /><Pointer number="4" />
