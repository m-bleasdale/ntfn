On Tuesday the 1st of July, the Labour government passed a new bill that drastically changes how PIP works in the UK. Prime Minister Keir Starmer argues that these changes have been needed for a long time and that this bill will help mend a system that discourages work among disabled individuals. Minister for Social Security and Disability Sir Stephen Timms argues that these reforms will focus on “opening up opportunities for those who can work” <Pointer number="1" /> while supporting those who can’t. Initially, these also aimed to save the government billions, which is crucial for the government's future spending plans. However, in its current state, critics argue that this bill will likely fail to save the necessary funds - which could have dire consequences for the Labour Party's plans.

### What is PIP? 

PIP (or personal independence payment) is a government benefit provided to disabled individuals under the state pension age. <Pointer number="2" /> To qualify for PIP, people are assessed in two key areas: mobility and daily living. If a person is impacted in either of these areas, they receive a standard pip rate. If this impact is considerable, they receive the enhanced rate. It is estimated that in England and Wales, around 3.7 million people qualify for PIP and around 37% qualify for the enhanced rate (as of the 31st January 2025). <Pointer number="3" />

### What Does The Amendment Change? 

However, the amendment changes how individuals are scored in the daily living component; increasing the minimum threshold required to receive benefits. This bill introduced a ‘4 point rule’ - where claimants had to be significantly impacted (scoring at least 4 points) in at least one area while also having at least 8 points overall. <Pointer number="4" /> This was known as ‘clause 5’ of the amendment. This change would result in 800,000 disabled people losing out on PIP payments while saving around $ 5.5 billion for the government. 

Additionally, the amendment affects those claiming Universal credit benefits, which used to only apply to those who could work for whatever reason. However, for people who already receive these benefits, looking for work won’t immediately trigger a potential reassessment, which was not the case before these amendments. This, in theory, will incentivise people on benefits to look for work.

### Criticisms and Changes to The Amendment 

However, these decisions caused outrage not only among British citizens but also within the Labour Party itself. Many Prominent Labor MPs supported this ‘rebellion' - including: Meg Hillier, Debbie Abrahams, Louise Haigh and Marie Tidball - who were huge influences on the movement. <Pointer number="5" /> These MPs criticised the motion for unfairly targeting the most vulnerable members of society - with the government's impact assessment estimating that 250,000 disabled people would be pushed into poverty. <Pointer number="6" /> Therefore, in anticipation of the voting process, around a third of the Labour Party voted for a ‘wrecking motion’ which listed the reasons that the ‘rebels’ disagreed with the amendment. 

Because of this, Keir likely would have faced a humiliating defeat at the hands of his party if he did not act. Therefore, the secretary of state, Liz Kendall, announced a concession that would lessen the impact that these changes would have on the disabled population. This new amendment would not affect people who already receive PIP, only targeting new claimants. <Pointer number="7" /> However, this ‘two-tier system’ sparked further discourse, eventually resulting in Stephen Timms announcing a strike to clause 5 in its entirety. <Pointer number="4" /> <Pointer number="7" /> This occurred two hours before the final vote, a complete ‘U-turn’ in what the amendment had initially attempted to achieve. Overall, the amendment passed with the majority of the changes to universal credit remaining intact, but its plan for PIP was completely ‘gutted’ according to conservative MPs. <Pointer number="8" />

### So What Happens Now? 

Impact assessments generally see this bill in a much more favourable light due to the major changes made, with an estimated 50,000 people being lifted out of relative poverty due to the changes put in place for universal credit. <Pointer number="6" /> With that being said, it is undeniable that the failure of the initial amendment has had disastrous effects on Keir’s government. It’s no secret that these ‘rebellions’ have been a PR disaster, and many have lost faith in the labour government if they hadn’t already. However, another huge problem is the complete lack of savings that this new amendment will allow. The Labor government expected to save £5.5 billion because of this amendment, but the latest concessions mean that there will likely be no net savings over the next few years. <Pointer number="9" /> Crucially, this puts pressure on Rachel Reeves’ spending plans - which were created with these savings in mind. The IFS deputy director Helen Miller states that extreme measures may be required to make up the difference, arguing that “tax rises would look increasingly likely". <Pointer number="9" /> Although this new amendment can be seen as beneficial, it ultimately fails at what it was designed to do, leaving the labour government in rocky waters moving forward.
