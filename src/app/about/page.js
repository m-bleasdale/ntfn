                    At No Time For News, our mission is to make the news more approachable and engaging for everyone by breaking down complex stories and big issues into clear, engaging summaries. 
                    We're a fully student-run initiative, committed to helping people stay informed without the overwhelm. 
                    Along the way, we're creating meaningful opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience in journalism, media and technology. Inspiring people to learn the ropes by actively shaping how news is delivered.

                    The world is full of information, but not all of it is useful. We believe news should be clear, concise, and free from unnecessary noise. Our goal is to help you stay informed without feeling overwhelmed â€” see the news that matters.

                    We've only just started building No Time For News, and there's a lot more to come. As we grow, we'll be creating more content, expanding our team, and finding better ways to deliver news that matters. If you're passionate about making a difference or want to help shape the future of student-led journalism, we'd love for you to join us on this journey.
