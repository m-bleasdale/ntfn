            <P>2 days ago, the 8th July 2025, we published our first article under the banner of our new news organisation <strong>No Time For News</strong>, or <strong>NTFN</strong> for short. This is a very exciting moment for our organisation.</P>
            <P>No Time For News is being created for two simple purposes:</P>
            <P>Firstly, to produce impartial, no-nonsense news that provides readers with only the most important stories, and explorations of general trends within politics or world news. News has become sensationalised, large news organisations easily produce hundreds of stories a week and it has become impossible to cut through the noise and identify which stories are actually worth your time. As students, entering the world of politics, business, economics, law and tech, we have found that understanding the world around us has become so difficult when there are so many opinions floating around - and it is even harder if you don’t have much time. And even once you find the stories worth your time, the task of verifying whether what you are reading is in fact honest, unbiased factually sound can become a nightmare.</P>
            <P>We wanted to build a platform where only the important information and general trends that are relevant is shown to our readers. Our platform is quite literally for people that have No Time For News. Only the important stories, and only the important information. No bias. No nonsense. That’s it.</P>
            <P>Secondly, we wanted to create an opportunity for students, like ourselves, to do something real. At No Time For News, everything including our research, articles, social media posts, website, paperwork, is created by students. We want to provide an opportunity for aspiring journalists to work within a national news organisation - but we also want to help aspiring developers build a real website used by real people and for aspiring lawyers to get real experience working in an organisation. This experience isn’t just so we have a badge on our LinkedIn. It is so we actually learn. Working within an organisation, no matter the size, is such invaluable life experience. And is something that not only helps employability, but helps us work as part of a group inorder to fulfill a unifying objective.</P>
            <P>No Time For News is new. It’s exciting. We might not change the world, but we can surely make a dent in it.</P>
            <P>We welcome talented aspiring journalists, developers, lawyers, marketing professionals, etc to reach out to us at <strong>contact@ntfn.co.uk</strong> if they want to get involved. Or DM us on social media. Any amount of experience is welcome, even if you’ve never written anything before.</P>
            <P>No contract. No commitment. Just contribute what you can.</P>
            <P>Thanks,<br/><strong>No Time For News Team</strong></P>
